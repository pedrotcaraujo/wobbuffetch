Reactive wrapper for HTTP requests using Fetch API

## Why

Handle asynchronous and event-based programs are boring. Sometimes we need to manipulate data loaded from the some server getting only what we need, merge, debounce, distinct and so on. Wobbuffetch is a reactive  http library that wrap Fetch API along with a set of observable collections that make your life easier.
